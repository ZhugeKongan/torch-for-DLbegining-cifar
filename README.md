pytorch builds a neural network: details make your network more perfect

  This article takes some details of the neural network implementation as the starting point, and takes the classification of the commonly used classification data set cifar10 as the task, and takes you to write a more perfect deep learning code.
  CIFAR10 is an image classification project of the kaggle computer vision competition. The data set has a total of 60,000 32*32 color images, which are divided into "plane", "car", "bird", "cat", "deer", "dog", "frog", "horse", "ship" , "truck" 10 categories, 6000 images in each category. There are 50,000 images used for training, forming 5 training batches, each batch of 10,000 images; 10,000 images used for testing, forming a single batch. You can click to download directly.
